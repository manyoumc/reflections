How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You see the changes since the last version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Getting an overview, Fixing Bugs more easily, Reset the code to the last functioning build

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    more work, more control, logical order of commits -> easier to navigate

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Changes in Google Docs are mostly non-related to other docs

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log -> see commits over time,  git diff -> see changes between two different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    easy and fast reset to an older version -> git checkout *commit-id*

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    experience & practice
